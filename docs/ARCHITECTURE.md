# FyyUI Architecture

FyyUI is developed as 19 ordered Luau source files and distributed as one generated `fyyui.lua` bundle. Runtime users still fetch one URL and execute one `loadstring`; files under `src/` are never fetched individually.

## Source tree

```text
src/
├── bootstrap.lua
├── components/
│   ├── toggle.lua
│   ├── slider.lua
│   ├── dropdown.lua
│   ├── keybind.lua
│   ├── input.lua
│   └── checkbox.lua
├── layout/
│   ├── columns.lua
│   └── collapsible.lua
├── navigation/
│   └── tab.lua
├── menu/
│   ├── constructor.lua
│   ├── navigation.lua
│   ├── overview.lua
│   ├── config.lua
│   ├── notifications.lua
│   ├── window.lua
│   ├── theme_tooltip.lua
│   └── palette.lua
└── export.lua
```

`bootstrap.lua` owns themes, utilities, validation, icon rendering, constants, and shared layout forward declarations. Components own their controllers. `columns.lua` and `collapsible.lua` share the forward-declared layout controllers because they can nest each other. `tab.lua` owns tab construction and all component factories. Menu files extend one shared `Menu` table in lifecycle order. `export.lua` creates and returns the public `FyyUI` table.

## Building

Edit source files, then regenerate the root bundle:

```bash
node scripts/build.js
```

Confirm that the committed bundle is synchronized without changing files:

```bash
node scripts/build.js --check
```

The build has a fixed source manifest, normalizes line endings, emits one shared closure, and produces deterministic output. Two consecutive builds must produce the same `fyyui.lua` hash.

The extraction helper exists only for rebuilding `src/` from a known compatible monolith:

```bash
node scripts/extract-modules.js --force path/to/monolith.lua
```

It intentionally refuses to overwrite `src/` without `--force`.

## Release rules

1. Treat `src/` as the source of truth.
2. Do not edit root `fyyui.lua` directly.
3. Keep public API and runtime behavior in the generated bundle.
4. Commit source changes and regenerated `fyyui.lua` together.
5. Run `node scripts/build.js --check`, StyLua verification, and the Roblox smoke harness before release.
6. Keep the root file because demos and users load it directly from GitHub with one request.

The generated file intentionally contains only the public copyright and license notice. Development and build instructions remain in this document instead of the runtime bundle header.
